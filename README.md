GUI version of the ISS tracker program - Author: Gustavo Wydler Azuaga - 04/06/2021
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is a python api-client that tracks the ISS (International space spation) coordinates.

* It tracks the ISS from a public API(http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json), parses the json format to text, and displays   its actual coordinates in the console.

* You can pre-select the iterations(How many times to show snapshots and coordinates), and refresh intervals(Amount of        seconds to show coordinates). 

* It will open Google Maps with firerox(using selenium, and show the ISS coordinates as they change, 
  taking snapshots of every location to store them in a folder by date. It also has a log file, 
  where it appends the raw data in txt format.

* You can also view the coordinates in a single GUI window, spot the ISSÂ´s location in the spotthestation.nasa.gov/tracking_map.cfm portal through selenium as well.
